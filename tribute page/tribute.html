    <p>
      Afewerk Tekle was one of Ethiopia's most iconic artists, leaving behind an
      impressive legacy of paintings, murals, and sculptures. His works are
      renowned for their bold colors, intricate designs, and unique perspectives
      on Ethiopian culture. Through his art, Afewerk sought to capture the
      essence of Ethiopia and its people. In this article, we will explore the
      life and legacy of this remarkable artist and discover how his art has
      impacted generations of Ethiopians. Maître Artist Afewerk Tekle Who Was
      Afewerk Tekle and What is His Lasting Cultural Legacy? Afework Tekle was
      born on October 22, 1932, in Ankober, Shewa Province, Ethiopia, to parents
      Felekech Yamatawork and Tekle Mamo, and grew up under Italian occupation
      during WWII. Following the war in 1947, Afewerk decided he wanted to help
      rebuild Ethiopia and chose to study mining engineering in England. Emperor
      Haile Selassie addressed Afewerk and other students who were leaving to
      study abroad before they left. "You must work hard, and when you return,
      do not tell us what tall buildings you saw in Europe, or what wide streets
      they have, but make sure you return equipped with the skills and mindset
      to rebuild Ethiopia." As a child, Afewerk demonstrated artistic talent by
      decorating several walls in his hometown. This talent was recognized, and
      encouraged by his teachers at Leighton Park School, an English boarding
      school. As a result, Afewerk was persuaded to abandon engineering and
      enroll in London's Central School of Arts and Crafts. He then went on to
      study painting, sculpture, and architecture at the Slade School of Art.
      When Afewerk returned to Ethiopia as a university graduate, he could have
      accepted an assigned ministerial post, but instead chose to spend time
      traveling around Ethiopia's provinces to gain a better understanding of
      his native country and culture, which he reflected in his paintings. Upon
      his return to Ethiopia Afework Tekle was determined to contribute to his
      country. However, the concept of 'art' was met with a different mindset in
      Ethiopia than in Europe. He was very aware of how privileged he had been
      to benefit from many great teachers, both in his country and abroad, and
      decided to devote his time to creating art and pro-actively campaigning in
      the name of his subject. However, it was difficult to gain recognition as
      an honorable person as an artist in Ethiopia, where the concept of ‘art’
      was met with a very different mindset to that of Europe. So he decided to
      exhibit in Africa, Europe, America, and all over the world. He was lucky
      to have the support of Emperor Haile Selassie, who after watching him put
      up with a lot of trouble and struggle, asked in wonder, “What is it that
      makes this little boy stick?”. In 1954, Afewerk Tekle held his first
      one-man show in Addis Ababa, at Municipality Hall, which provided him with
      the funds to travel around Europe for two years, learning how to design
      and construct stained glass windows. He also conducted research on
      Ethiopian illustrated manuscripts in the British Library, the Bibliothèque
      Nationale in Paris, and the Vatican Library. Afewerk returned to Ethiopia
      and established a studio in the National Library of Ethiopia. His growing
      popularity led to government commissions for murals and mosaics in Addis
      Ababa’s St. George's Cathedral, and several of his designs were used on
      national stamps. He was also commissioned to create sculptures of famous
      Ethiopians, but only the massive Ras Makonnen statue in Harrar was
      completed. Most notably, in 1958, he created “Total Liberation of Africa”,
      a stained glass piece in Addis Ababa's Africa Hall of the United Nations
      Economic Commission for Africa. The three windows cover an area of 150
      square meters and represent Africa's sorrow in the past, its struggle in
      the present, and its hope for the future. Maître Artist Afewerk Tekle
      played a major role in the development of modern art in Ethiopia. He had a
      major retrospective in Addis Ababa in 1961, which resulted in his
      Expressionism-style painting “Maskal Flower”, being shown at international
      exhibitions in Russia, the United States, and Senegal. Thanks to increased
      funds, Afewerk was able to travel around Africa. With much of Africa still
      recovering from colonialism, he became obsessed with black emancipation
      and independence struggles. This is reflected in his paintings from this
      period, which has titles such as “Backbones of African Civilization” and
      “African Unity”. He was the first laureate of the Haile Selassie I Prize
      for Fine Arts in 1964. As his reputation grew, Afewerk was invited to put
      on an exhibition in Moscow, after which he lectured throughout the Soviet
      Union. The American government responded by inviting one-man shows in
      Washington D.C. and New York, as well as a lecture tour of American
      universities. Senegal, Turkey, Zaire, the United Arab Republic, Bulgaria,
      Munich, Kenya, and Algeria hosted additional international exhibitions.
      Throughout the 1970s, Afewerk was busy creating murals and mosaics for a
      variety of public and religious buildings throughout Ethiopia, including
      the mural “Last Judgement” in Adigrat, Tigray. His painting “Unity
      Triptych” won the gold medal at the Algiers International Festival in
      1977. In the early 1980s, there was a second major exhibition in Moscow,
      as well as one in Bonn. His painting “Self-portrait” was the first by an
      African artist to be accepted into the permanent collection of the Uffizi
      Gallery in Florence, Italy, in 1981. In 1997, he won first prize in the
      international competition at the Biennale of Aquitaine in France. He was
      also named Biennale Laureate, earning him membership in the French
      International Academy of Arts. In 1983, Afewerk Tekle became the first
      African member of the Russian Academy of Arts. He lived in Addis Ababa,
      but also had a second home in Hawassa, in the Sidama Region, near Lake
      Hawassa. His residence in Addis Ababa is called “Vila Alpha” and it is
      currently a museum. Here is a video of Afewerk Tekle showing this
      residence. . . Afewerk Tekle died on April 10, 2012, from severe stomach
      ulcer complications after being treated at a private hospital in Addis
      Ababa. He was buried at the Holy Trinity Cathedral cemetery in Addis
      Ababa. Afewerk's death was widely publicized in the country, and a funeral
      was planned by a national committee. He is best known for his iconic
      paintings, which combine traditional Ethiopian motifs with modern
      techniques. His works have been exhibited around the world, from London
      and Moscow to Senegal and Algiers, and are considered to be some of the
      most influential pieces of Ethiopian art in the 20th century. His legacy
      has been felt in both Ethiopia's artistic and cultural landscape, making
      him one of the most important figures in Ethiopia as and Africa’s art
      history. Afewerk Tekle’s Creative Process & His Most Famous Works Afewerk
      Tekle has left a lasting mark on the world of art. His creative process
      was unique and inspired many to take up art as a profession. He is best
      known for his vivid paintings, sculptures, and murals that often depicted
      Ethiopia's history and culture. Now, let’s explore Afewerk Tekle's
      creative process as well as some of his most famous works. Ras Mekonnen’s
      Monument Ras Mekonnen’s Monument was developed by Laureate Afewerk Tekle
      and Croatian sculptors Antun Augustincic & Frano Krsinic in the mid-1950s.
      Ras Makonnen was a first cousin of Emperor Menelik II and was a military
      leader, the governor of Harar province in Ethiopia, and the father of
      Emperor Haile Selassie. The statue was erected to honor the significance
      of his contribution to his people and country. Ras Makonnen's statue was
      placed in Harar, Ethiopia in 1958 and destroyed by hooligans in 2020.
      Hoodlums and extremists destroyed Ethiopia's national relic due to hatred
      and animosity based on false Amhara's history Altar cross (1959) at Royal
      Chapel in the Tower of London, England Looking eastward from the Royal
      Chapel nave, the altar cross is clearly of a design and shape not commonly
      seen in English churches. It is, in fact, a processional cross made of
      worked and patterned silver, which Ethiopians are familiar with. A simple
      wooden cross can be seen within the silver upon closer inspection. The
      chapel's archives contain a letter written by artist Afewerk Tekle on
      January 20, 1967. This demonstrates that he created the cross and was
      inspired by "the harmonious unity of the two elements (wood and silver).
      The silver around the wooden cross is inspired by the ancient motifs of
      Ethiopian crosses, " he adds. Murals and paintings at St George's
      Cathedral (Addis Ababa) This Piazza St George cathedral is one of Addis'
      most beautiful churches, commissioned by Emperor Menelik II to commemorate
      his stunning 1896 defeat of the Italians in Adwa and dedicated to St
      George (Ethiopia's patron saint), whose icon was carried into the battle.
      The interior's flashes of color and art easily outshine the grey stone
      exterior. Sections of the ceiling are sky-blue with gilded stars, and the
      outer walls of the innermost shrine are covered in Afewerk Tekle's
      paintings and mosaics. The above mosaic painting is titled "King Solomon
      meets the Queen of Sheba. This painting by The Most Honourable World
      Laureate Maître Artiste Afewerk Tekle hangs In St. George's Cathedral,
      Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Orthodox Christians in Ethiopia believe the
      Biblical Queen of Sheba was a ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon
      in Jerusalem in ancient Israel. Afewerk Tekle's painting of Solomon and
      Sheba is one of the greatest biblical paintings of a great artist. It is
      full of European influences but maintains an element of the Ethiopian
      style. Tekle draws the viewer's attention to the aesthetic beauty of the
      king and queen, taking the time to draw the gold trim of Sheba's crown and
      the precise point of her slippers. He also captures the grand nature of
      Solomon's reign, using rich vibrant colors to illustrate his extreme
      wealth. Verse one of Kings chapter ten alludes to the large train of
      servants that accompany Sheba into Solomon's midst, and Tekle places the
      King of Israel on a throne above the bustle, illustrating the power and
      influence of Solomon. The meeting of Sheba and Israel is a metaphor for
      the peace and general wealth the Israelites enjoyed during the reign of
      Solomon. Maskal Flower (1961) Maskal Flower - By Afewerk Tekle This
      artwork is titled "Maskal Flower" and was painted in 1959 by the great
      Artist Afework Tekle. The portrait depicts a lovely lady dressed in
      traditional Ethiopian attire, holding a maskal flower, which signifies the
      start of the Ethiopian New Year. At this time of year, yellow flowers grow
      wild throughout Ethiopia. Total Liberation of Africa (1961) in Africa
      Hall, Addis Ababa Total Liberation of Africa - Afewerk T. The Organisation
      of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for
      Africa (ECA) was going to be established. So, every country in Africa was
      allowed to submit an entry for a window titled 'Africa Then, Africa Then
      and Now, Africa's Future' (or: 'Africa's Past, Present & Future'). An
      Italian who was competing with Afewerk Tekle, had depicted a pygmy holding
      a large book that read 'Education,' a tall Tutsi tribesman holding a small
      sword that read 'Defence,' and for the central window 'Future,' he showed
      all the different types of African people, with an emerging sphinx
      dominating the entire design. Tekle disagreed with this interpretation:
      the notion that the only thing to remember “was the sphinx, that every
      other nation in Africa was merely a colony’." Tekle's take on the theme
      was as follows: He depicted slavery in 'Africa Then,' with the devil
      dancing over enslaved Africans. For the second window, titled 'Africa Then
      and Now,' he depicted a map of the continent filled with people, some of
      whom were already liberated, looking outwards. Others remain in the
      shadows, with a large red bird flying overhead, symbolizing colonialism.
      An African man wielding a sword chases the bird away. Finally, for the
      middle frame, there is a crowd of people, each figure representing a
      different freed African country, all dressed in their national attire,
      with an Ethiopian family prominently displayed. The competition day
      arrived, and Tekle's masterpiece received 14 of the 17 judges' votes. He
      was declared the winner. Total Liberation of Africa - Afewerk T. The Last

      influence of religion in his life, and how it shaped his artistic vision.
